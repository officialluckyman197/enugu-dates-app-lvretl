You want an Android app built with React Native and Expo 54 that suggests dates and picnic locations in Enugu metropolis, tailored to couples' budget, location, and style preferences. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Personalized Recommendations:** The core feature will be providing date and picnic location suggestions based on user input (budget, location, style).\n-   **Location Display:** Display the suggested locations on a map using a map library.\n-   **User Input Forms:** Create forms to capture user preferences (budget, location, style).\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White)\n    *   Text: `#282828` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#585858` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#FF69B4` (Bright Pink)\n    *   Secondary: `#BA55D3` (Medium Purple)\n    *   Accent: `#20B2AA` (Light Sea Green)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFB6C1` (Light Pink)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\", the default for the platform, for readability and a contemporary feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create UI elements for user input:** Create components for budget, location, and style input.\n2.  **Implement recommendation logic:** Create a function that takes user input and returns a list of date/picnic suggestions. For now, this can be hardcoded with a few options.\n3.  **Display recommendations:** Display the recommendations in a user-friendly format, including location on a map.\n4.  **Implement navigation:** Ensure smooth navigation between the input forms and the recommendation display.\n5.  **Refactor the app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx file:** Remove the modalDemos array from the app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx file.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement this plan.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-01T22:41:30.855591"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build an Android app that suggests dates and picnic locations for couples and friends in Enugu metropolis.
